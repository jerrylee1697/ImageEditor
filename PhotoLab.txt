Programs Functionality:
This program is an extension of the previous 2 weeks program,
implementing four additional functions and allowing the program
to accept dynamically sized pictures. 

Function Implementations:
General   - All functions were reimplemented to be able to work with
            any sized photo using pointers. Our previously used 2-D
            arrays are changed into a 1-D array as pointers and
            each point is calculated accordingly to pinpoint its pixel
            location in the photo. 

Crop      - The function takes the point from which the picture will
            be cropped and how much of it will be. I have added extra
            constraints so that if the desired cropping is larger
            than available in the picture, it will automatically crop
            the maximum size it can from the chosen point.

Resize    - The picture is recreated based on the selected percentage,
            then using the formulas, is able to recreate the picture
            larger or smaller without looking different besides
            pixel quality.
            
Brightness And Contrast - The function is able to take percentages 
            and adjust each pixel density accordingly based on
            the provided formulas.

Watermark - The watermark simply iterates through all the pixels in 
            both the original image and the watermark sample. If it
            detects whitespace in the watermark, it will alter the 
            original photos pixel density at the same point to 
            show the watermark. Using modula, the watermark will be
            written again if the original picture is larger.
